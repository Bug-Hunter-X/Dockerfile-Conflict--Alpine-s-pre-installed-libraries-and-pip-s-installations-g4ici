This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles when using Alpine Linux and pip. The `Dockerfile` attempts to install Python packages using pip, but this may conflict with packages already present in the Alpine image. This can lead to unexpected errors or runtime issues. The `Dockerfile-solution` provides a fix for this problem using a virtual environment to isolate the Python dependencies.
